The `Alarm`, `Event`, `ManagedObject` and `Operation` events now no longer throw exceptions from the `isCreate()` and `isUpdate()` actions. If the event being checked was generated in EPL code, these two actions now simply return false. `try ... catch` blocks around these calls are no longer necessary if the event being checked was generated in EPL code. In the unlikely case that the `try ... catch` block is used to intentionally check for internally generated events, you need to change the check to the following:

```
if not (evt.isCreate() or evt.isUpdate()) { ... }
```
