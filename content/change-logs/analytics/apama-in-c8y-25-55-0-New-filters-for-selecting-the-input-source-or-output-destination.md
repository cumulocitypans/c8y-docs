In Analytics Builder, the dialog box that appears when you select a different input source or output destination for an input or output block now allows you to filter the entries that appear in this dialog box. By default, the dialog box displays all defined devices, device groups, smart groups and assets. This is the same as the previous behavior. If you also want to display other managed objects in the dialog box, you can now select the "Other" check box.
See also [Editing the parameters of a block](https://cumulocity.com/docs/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#editing-the-parameters-of-a-block) in the user documentation.
