This update enables adding multiple links to the Login page by a custom application configuration. These links will be displayed on all public-facing pages of the site, not only on the Login page. This provides a consistent experience for users accessing public pages, with easy access to extra helpful links from any page. You can add a privacy notice, for example, or a terms and conditions link.
